Visual Analogy
IaaS: Like renting an empty apartment—you bring your own furniture, appliances, and decorate as you wish.
PaaS: Like renting a fully furnished apartment—you just bring your personal items and start living.
SaaS: Like staying in a hotel—everything is provided, you just use the services.
